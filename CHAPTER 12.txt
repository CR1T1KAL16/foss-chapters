2. It returns a response object. To access the downloaded content as a string value we use
   text() function with the response object.
   
3. requests.get().status_code == requests.codes.ok. the status code for OK is 200, and if the status code
   for the response is 200, that would mean it has established connection with the web page.
   
4. requests.get().status_code

5. Using open() and write() function. We write the data in binary mode to maintain the unicode 
   encoding of the text. The iter_content() returns chunks of the content so that we can iterate
   through using for loop, as content can be too big.
