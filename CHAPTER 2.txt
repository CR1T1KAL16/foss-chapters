CHAPTER 2

Practice Questions

1. 1 and 0. They're written as "True" and "False"

2. and, or and not.

3. AND truth table:

	a     b     output
	0     0       0
	0     1       0
	1     0       0
	1     1       1

   OR truth table:

	a     b     output
	0     0       0
	0     1       1  
	1     0       1
	1     1       1

   NOT truth table:

	a   output
	0     1
	1     0

4. False
   False
   True
   False
   False
   True

5. >, <, =, !=, <= and >=

6. equal to operator is used to check if two values are the same and does not store any values or other data. 
   Assignment operator is used to assign a particular value on the right to a variable on the left which is stored in the memory for later use.

7. Condition is basically another term for the boolean values. A condition statement returns either True or False depending on the input. It is typically used in an If-Else statement.

8. First block:
	spam = 0
	print("spam")
   Second block:
	if spam == 10:
		print("eggs")
	print("spam)
   Third block:
	if spam > 5:
		print("bacon")
	else:
		print("ham")

9. spam=int(input("enter value of spam: "))
   if spam==1:
	print("Hello")
   elif spam==2:
	print("Howdy")
   else:
	print("Greetings!")

10. alt + F4

11. break ends the loop, and no statement runs after the break statement.
    continue skips the current value/input and moves on to the next traversing element. It does not end the loop but only skips the
    specific elements.

12. All of the given range are the same. The argument contains the start, end and step value, and the default values of start and step
    value are 0 and 1 respectively. End value is a necessary value to input.

13. Using for loop:
	for i in range(1,11):
		print(i)
    Using while loop:
	n=0
	while n<11:
		n=n+1
		print(n)

14. spam.bacon()
