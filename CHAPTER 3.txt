CHAPTER 3

1. => They can be used multiple times in the same code.
   => The code gets tidier.

2. The code in the function is executed only when the function is called outside.

3. def statement creates a function.

4. Function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
   A function call is used to call the function for it to work.

5. There's only one global scope in a python program. There can be n number of local scopes (number of functions)

6. The variables are destroyed after the execution of the function.

7. return value can be any element you want from a function, to use elsewhere in the code. It can also be used in an expression.

8. The return value will be None

9. Using global function, you can convert a local variable to a global variable.

10. Nonetype

11. It lets you to use the user-defined functions in that particular module.

12. spam.bacon()

13. Using try-except statements.

14. Inside the try clause will be the code, and the error type inside the except clause.

The Collatz Sequence

import sys
def collatz(number):
    if number==1:
        sys.exit()
    if number%2==0:
        print(number//2)
        collatz(number//2)   
    else:
        print(3 * number + 1)
        collatz(3*number+1)
    
try:
    collatz(int(input()))
except ValueError:
    print("please enter an integer")
